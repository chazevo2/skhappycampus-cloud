If you have GParted open, close it. Its Swapoff feature does not appear to to be permanent.
 
Open terminal and become root (su); if you have sudo enabled, you may also do for example sudo -i; see man sudo for all options):
sudo -i
 
Check if swap is on
cat /proc/swaps
 
Turn off the particular swap partition and / or all of the swaps:
swapoff --all
 
Make 100% sure the particular swap partition partition is off:
cat /proc/swaps
 
Open a text editor you are skilled in with this file, e.g. nano if unsure:
nano /etc/fstab
 
Comment out / remove the swap partition's UUID, e.g.:
# UUID=1d3c29bb-d730-4ad0-a659-45b25f60c37d    none    swap    sw    0    0
 
Open a text editor you are skilled in with this file, e.g. nano if unsure:
nano /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
 
Comment out / remove the previously identified swap partition's UUID, e.g.:
# RESUME=UUID=1d3c29bb-d730-4ad0-a659-45b25f60c37d
 
Don't close the terminal as you will need it later anyway.
 
Note: The next steps differ depending on, whether you rely on CLI or GUI.
 
GUI:
 
Open up GParted, either from menu, or more conveniently from the terminal we have opened:
gparted
 
If you don't have it installed, you may do so; afterwards run the previous command again:
apt-get install gparted
 
Choose your drive from top-right menu.
 
As the GParted reactivates the swap partition upon launch, you will have to right-click the particular swap partition and click Swapoff -> This will be applied immediately.
 
Delete the swap partition with right click -> Delete. You must apply the change now.
 
Resize your main / other partition with right click -> Resize/Move. You must apply the change now.
 
Back to the terminal, let's recreate the boot images:
update-initramfs -u -k all
 
Update GRUB:
update-grub
 
You may reboot now if you wish to test that the machine boots up.
